# README

Simple blog written with Ruby on Rails

P.S. commits are spammed with cache files :no_mouth:. I just forgot to use gitignore. And used RubyMine. So yes. It's JetBrains. Tons of cache files :dizzy_face:

**Note!**
Select image fields are raw - nothing is changed on UI after picking image - so don't be confused about it  

**Entities:**

* User { email, nickname, avatar, description }
* Post { image, message }

**Pages:**

* Home page (actually no design, simply 2 buttons)
* Login page that supports entering either email or nickname (and password of course :grin:)
* Registration page with email, password, nick, avatar, description
* Feed page with posts

**Fetures:**

* Each form has validation (made by redirection tho, so forms are cleared if smth is invalid :confused:)
* Active storage used for saving images
* Authorization, registration
* Likesssss :+1:
* Simple and kinda minimalistic design

Hope you enjoy it :yum:
